1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,945
Hooh hoooh

2
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:23,190
Please don't see
just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies

3
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:34,025
Please see me
reaching out for someone I can see

4
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:39,553
Take my hand
let's see where we wake up tomorrow

5
00:00:39,753 --> 00:00:45,472
Best laid plans
sometimes it's just a one night stand

6
00:00:45,672 --> 00:00:51,338
I'd be damned
Cupid's demanding back his arrow

7
00:00:51,538 --> 00:00:58,528
So let's get drunk on our tears and

8
00:00:58,728 --> 00:01:06,333
God, tell us the reason
youth is wasted on the young

9
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:12,351
It's hunting season
and the lambs are on the run

10
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:15,147
Searching for meaning

11
00:01:15,703 --> 00:01:27,849
But are we all lost stars,
trying to light up the dark?

12
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:38,718
Who are we?
Just a spec of dust within the galaxy

13
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:49,950
Woe is me
if we're not careful turns into reality

14
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:55,775
Don't you dare
let all these memories bring you sorrow

15
00:01:55,975 --> 00:02:01,673
Yesterday
I saw a lion kiss a deer

16
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:07,595
Turn the page
maybe we'll find a brand new ending

17
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:14,874
Where we're dancing in our tears and

18
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:22,502
God, tell us the reason
youth is wasted on the young

19
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:28,397
It's hunting season
and the lambs are on the run

20
00:02:28,597 --> 00:02:31,386
Searching for meaning

21
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:42,592
But are we all lost stars,
trying to light up the dark?

22
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:48,361
Hoo hoo hoo
And I thought I saw you out there crying

23
00:02:48,561 --> 00:02:54,216
Hoo hoo
And I thought I heard you call my name

24
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:59,904
Yeah Yeah
And I thought I heard you out there crying

25
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:07,754
Oh Just the same
Oh Yeah... yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

26
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:14,957
God, give us the reason
youth is wasted on the young

27
00:03:15,157 --> 00:03:21,110
It's hunting season
and these lambs are on the run

28
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,720
Searching for meaning

29
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:35,888
But are we all lost stars,
trying to light, light up the dark?

30
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:41,103
Hoo hoo
And I thought I saw you out there crying

31
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:46,869
Hoo hoo
And I thought I heard you call my name

32
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:52,765
Hoo hooo
And I thought I heard you out there crying

33
00:03:52,965 --> 00:04:05,216
Oh but are we all lost stars,
trying to light up the dark?

34
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:20,916
Are we all lost stars,
trying to light up the dark?
